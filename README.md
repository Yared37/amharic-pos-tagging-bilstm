Amharic Part-of-Speech Tagging Using BiLSTM

This project implements a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging model for the Amharic language using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network.
It aims to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) research for low-resource languages, particularly Amharic — one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa.

🚀 Overview

Part-of-Speech tagging is a fundamental task in NLP that assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence.
While English and other major languages benefit from extensive datasets and pre-trained models, Amharic lacks robust open-source POS taggers.
This project bridges that gap by training a deep learning model specifically designed for Amharic text.

🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses a BiLSTM network to capture both past and future context of words in a sentence.
This bidirectional nature allows the model to understand how surrounding words influence a token’s grammatical role.

Model Pipeline:

Text preprocessing and tokenization

Word embedding representation

BiLSTM layers for context understanding

Dense output layer with softmax activation for tag prediction

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
Language: Python

📊 Dataset

Source: Amharic tagged corpus (mention your dataset if public, e.g. “the Amharic POS dataset from the Ethiopian NLP research group”).

Format: Each sentence is tokenized with corresponding POS labels.

Preprocessing: Text normalization, token encoding, and sequence padding.

If you used a custom dataset, you can describe how it was collected or annotated.

🔍 Evaluation

The model’s performance is measured using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Results demonstrate strong performance in capturing linguistic patterns unique to Amharic morphology and syntax.


Example Output

Input Sentence:

አባቴ ቤት ሄደ።

Predicted POS Tags:

አባቴ → Noun
ቤት → Noun
ሄደ። → Verb
